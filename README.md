# Code-Quiz


Coding quiz assignment made in Javascript  for Homework assignment 4.

Quiz is made up of 5 question. 

I added a timer that counts down when the quiz starts. If you don't finish before the time ends you get a zero.

Added style to the page so the answers are in a unordered list to keep them lined up together.

Added buttons so when you click on an answer it goes to the next question.
